# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from my [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    company_dim.name as company_name,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

        salary_year_avg
        
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE
        job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = top_paying_jobs.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
